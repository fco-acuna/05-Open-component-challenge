The point of this LeWagon Exercise was to reproduce the following layout. I chose to do it about Mercedes Benz instead of Oranges

<div class="text-center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/fullstack-images/master/frontend/open-component-challenge-structure.png" alt="">
</div>

It was a very fun challenge using HTML and CSS to achieve something kind of cool.
